<h2>Part-Time Burglar</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Part-time worker trying to steal as much money as you can!
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
It uses a basic state system for each of the rooms and customers
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
I learned how to use timers and random timed events.
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
The hardest part was managing tints of each of the tables' states, and balancing the game to not make it too easy/hard.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? TEST
<ul>
<li>Loading screen: self-made</li>
<li>Player: <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/1060496-Higher-Resolution-Pixel-Man"></a></li>
<li>Boss: <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/3371768-Godfather-Sicilian-Mafia-Pixel-Art"></a></li>
<li>Safe: <a href="https://4vector.com/free-vector/safe-clip-art-114415"></a></li>
<li>Table: <a href="https://www.ezeeoptimus.com/features.php"></a></li>
<li>Register: <a href="http://www.business-clipart.com/business_clipart_images/cash_register_0515-0911-1622-0302_SMU.jpg"></a></li>
<li>Sink: <a href="http://dullahansoft.com/pixel/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sink-big.png"></a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
This is most similar, or will be, most similar to diner dash???
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You are a burglar working as a waiter to get close to and crack open the safe, but you need to do so without alerting your bosses and serving tables!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Modern
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Stealth, Quick-time, Time management/allocation
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Timed events
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Tension and anticipation of being caught while gathering a high score
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Players use 1, 2, 3 and 4 to move through the rooms.  Players can press R to crack open the safe.  Once it is opened,
press R to gather money. Do not get caught doing so by your boss! To serve a table, stand in the appropriate room and press E.
You will then have dirty dishes to be placed in the sink in room 2.  To clean and dispose of the dishes, press T in room 2.
If a customer waits too long (a table is red for too long), the game is over.  Players can also rob the register at
a lower rate by pressing R in room 4.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
Keep track of when the security guards change places, and serve tables when the guards are watching the register or safe.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are a burglar working as a waiter to get close to and crack open the safe, but you need to do so without alerting your bosses and serving tables!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Everyone
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
1 minute.
</li>

<li><strong>Feedback from Physical Prototype:</strong></li>
<li>The game builds upon the previous iteration by adding customers, the sink, and the cash register to add more depth to the game, and to allow the player to make
more decisions in the 1 minute timespan.
</li>
