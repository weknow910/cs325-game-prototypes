I learned how to use timers and random timed events.
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
The hardest part was managing tints of each of the tables' states (work in progress!)
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? TEST
