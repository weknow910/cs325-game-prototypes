The hardest part was making the bullet sprites fire correctly.

Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
This is most similar to invaders, and I based some of the bullet algorithm off of the invaders phaser example.
